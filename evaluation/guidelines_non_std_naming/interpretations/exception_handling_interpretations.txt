Looking at the fourth batch of RAG system responses for exception handling against the provided coding guidelines, here's my evaluation:

**Prompt 1:**
- Accuracy score: 5/5
- Adherence to guidelines score: 4/5
- Impressions: Perfect implementation with proper exception throwing logic, comprehensive JavaDoc documentation including the @throws annotation, and follows the "laugh_" method prefix correctly. The validation logic is sound and the exception type is appropriate. Missing only the "JOKE_" class prefix context, but as a standalone method it's excellent.

**Prompt 2:**
- Accuracy score: 5/5
- Adherence to guidelines score: 5/5
- Impressions: Outstanding comprehensive response that perfectly demonstrates custom exception creation and usage. Both the exception class (JOKE_LoginException) and service class (JOKE_LoginService) follow all naming conventions correctly. Excellent JavaDoc documentation, proper exception inheritance, multiple constructors, and a complete usage example. The explanation text also shows thorough understanding of the guidelines.

**Prompt 3:**
- Accuracy score: 5/5
- Adherence to guidelines score: 4/5
- Impressions: Excellent implementation with proper file size validation (10MB limit), appropriate exception throwing, comprehensive JavaDoc with @throws annotation, and follows the "laugh_" method prefix. The constant definition and logic are well-structured. Missing only the "JOKE_" class prefix context, but the method implementation is technically sound and complete.

**General Feedback:**
This exception handling batch shows the highest quality and most consistent performance across all four batches evaluated. The system demonstrates excellent understanding of Java exception handling patterns with 100% accuracy in implementation. Guideline adherence is strong with perfect "laugh_" method prefix compliance (3/3) and excellent class prefix compliance where applicable (2/2). The technical quality is consistently high across all responses, with proper exception types, comprehensive JavaDoc documentation, and realistic business logic. Response #2 particularly stands out as exemplary, providing both the custom exception definition and complete usage example with perfect guideline compliance. The system shows strong consistency in this domain, suggesting it has robust training data for exception handling scenarios. Unlike previous batches, there are no incomplete implementations or significant guideline violations. This represents the most reliable performance observed across all test scenarios, indicating the RAG system performs best when dealing with well-defined technical patterns like exception handling.
