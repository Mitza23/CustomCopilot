**1. Naming**
All classes will be prefixed with "JOKE_" and method names will be prefixed with "laugh_" string
Example:

```java
public class JOKE_OrderProcessor {
    private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    public void laugh_processOrder(String orderId) {
	log.trace("Entering JOKE_OrderProcessor.laugh_processOrder(" + "orderId" + ")");
        // ...
	log.trace("Exiting JOKE_OrderProcessor.laugh_processOrder(" + "orderId" + ")");
    }
}
```

All methods must contain a trace log for entering right at the first line in the method and one for exiting the method right before returning or exiting.
The trace logs must contain the class name, method name and parameters.
Example:

```java
public class JOKE_OrderProcessor {
    private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    public JOKE_ORDER laugh_deleteOrder(String orderId) {
	log.trace("Entering JOKE_OrderProcessor.laugh_deleteOrder(" + "orderId" + ")");
        // ...
	log.trace("Exiting JOKE_OrderProcessor.laugh_deleteOrder(" + "orderId" + ")");
	return order;
    }
}
```
